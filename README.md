# Project Title
[HF Juventus](https://technikerschule.juventus.ch/angebote/informatik/) term paper web development (4th semester computer science, year 2018)
This is a Web Application that gets data from the public API of [TMDb](https://www.themoviedb.org) and displays it.

## Requirements:
The user should be able to:
- to search films (by title)
- View the top 20 rated movies
- View the top 20 rated movies per category
- Show upcoming movies
- Display the 20 most popular movies
- View and filter a list of recent searches
    - Filter by date
    - Filter by number of entries
- Add / remove movies to a favorite list
- Display the favorites list
No login required. Every user has the same favorites.
Several results (films) must be presented in an overview.
Detail view of a result (movie) must be able to be displayed.

## Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

Install [WebStorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/) and [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (>=8)  with NPM (>=5.2).

### Installing Frontend
Open the Project in the WebStorm Application, open its terminal and run the following command to install all the dependencies.
```
npm install
```
Start the web server
```
npm run start
```

### Installing Backend

Install [WebStorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/), [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (>=8\) with NPM (>=5.2) and [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/).
Get the code from this Github [Juventus_Semesterarbeit_Webentwicklung_4I_2018_Database](https://github.com/christianpetri/Juventus_Semesterarbeit_Webentwicklung_4I_2018_Database)

Open the Project in the WebStorm Application, open its terminal and run the following command to install all the dependencies.
```
npm install
```

Change the following line of code in the file named app.js:
```javascript
var url = 'path/to/your/MongoDB/Server'
```

Start the service
```
npm run start
```
Also the MongoDB has to be running in the background.

# testing the setup


Start the front, the backend and the MongoDB
and go to the browser and enter
```
http://localhost:8000/?#test
```
## Success

Connected to the TMDb API
Backend online
Connected successfully to the MongoDB

## Possible errors
### API and Backend offline
Not connected to the TMDb API (Are you offline?)
Backend offline. (Restart Backend with npm run start)
### API offline and Backend online
Not connected to the TMDb API (Are you offline?)
Backend is online
Connected successfully to the MongoDB
